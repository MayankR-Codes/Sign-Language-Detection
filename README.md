# Real-Time-Object-Detection
✋ Real-Time Sign Language Gesture Detection
🎯 Recognizing hand gestures in real time using computer vision and deep learning.
🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to build a real-time sign language gesture detection system that recognizes common hand gestures (like Hello, Thank You, Yes, No, etc.) through a camera feed.

The system uses computer vision and deep learning to detect and classify each gesture on-screen — similar to an object detection model, but trained specifically for hand gestures.

This project helps create more inclusive communication tools for individuals who use sign language, and can also be used in education, accessibility, and human-computer interaction.

🚀 Key Features

Real-time hand gesture detection using webcam or camera input.

Displays the name of the detected gesture (e.g., “Hello”).

Works like object detection — detects hands and classifies gesture type.

Scalable to add more gestures in the future.

Can be integrated into apps, kiosks, or assistive devices.

⚙️ System Workflow

Camera Input

Capture video frames using OpenCV.

Hand Detection

Detect the hand region using MediaPipe Hands or a custom trained detector (like YOLO or SSD).

Gesture Classification

Extract key points (landmarks) from the detected hand.

Feed them into a trained CNN or LSTM model that predicts the gesture class (e.g., “Hello”, “Yes”).

Display Output

Show the gesture label in real time on the video feed.

(Optional) Add sound output to speak the detected gesture name.

🧰 Technologies Used
Category	Tools / Libraries
Programming Language	Python
Computer Vision	OpenCV, MediaPipe
Deep Learning	TensorFlow / PyTorch
Visualization	OpenCV Window / Streamlit App
Hardware	Webcam or built-in camera
📊 Dataset Preparation

You can use one of the following options:

Custom Dataset – Record your own gesture videos or images for signs like Hello, Thank You, Yes, No, etc.

🧠 Model Training Steps

Data Collection

Capture multiple samples for each gesture.

Preprocessing

Resize images and normalize pixel values.

Optionally extract hand landmarks using MediaPipe Hands.

Model Design

Train a CNN to classify gestures from images or hand keypoints.

Evaluation

Test accuracy using a validation dataset.

Real-Time Detection

Combine trained model with OpenCV for live camera feed.

Continuously detect and display gesture names.

💡 Example Output

When you show a gesture (like “Hello”),
the camera feed will display a bounding box or text label like:

Gesture: Hello ✋

…and it updates instantly as you change gestures!
